## Features

- 📰 **Clean Interface**: Minimalist design focused on readability
- ⚡ **Menu Bar Integration**: Quick access without cluttering your dock

- 🎯 **Native macOS**: Built specifically for macOS using Swift
- 💾 **Lightweight**: Minimal resource usage and fast performance

## Requirements

- macOS 10.15+ (Catalina or later)
- Xcode 12.0+ (for building from source)

## Installation

### Download Pre-built App (Recommended)

1. **Download the latest release:**
   - Go to [Releases](https://github.com/AlbertoBarrago/RSS-Reader/releases/latest)
   - Download `RSSReader-X.X.X.dmg`

2. **Install the app:**
   - Open the downloaded DMG file
   - Drag `RSSReader.app` to your Applications folder
   - **Do NOT open the app yet**

3. **⚠️ Important: Bypass macOS Gatekeeper (Required for unsigned apps)**

   Since the app is not code-signed, macOS will block it with a "damaged" error. To fix this, open Terminal and run:

   ```bash
   xattr -cr /Applications/RSSReader.app
   ```

   **What this does:** Removes the quarantine flag that macOS applies to downloaded apps.

   **Alternative method** (may not work on all macOS versions):
   - Right-click `RSSReader.app` in Applications
   - Select "Open"
   - Click "Open" again in the security dialog

4. **Launch the app:**
   - Now you can open RSS Reader from Applications or Spotlight
   - The app will appear in your menu bar

> **Note:** This is a safe, open-source application. The "damaged" warning is a standard macOS security measure for unsigned apps. You can verify the source code in this repository. I'm working on getting the app properly code-signed to eliminate this step in future releases.

### Build from Source

1. **Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AlbertoBarrago/RSS-Reader.git

```

3. **Configure target:**
   - Select "My Mac" from the destination menu in Xcode
   - Ensure you're targeting macOS (not iOS simulator)

4. **Build and run:**
   - Press `Cmd + R` or click the Run button
   - For command-line builds, see [RUN.md](RUN.md)
